# CS-370
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For the intelligent agent program in this commit, python code was provided by the instructor. I generated code for the AI learning algorithm and the training algorithm.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer Scientists develop software for a variety of solutions - everywhere from full-stack, to UI/UX design, to programming artificial intelligence. This course focused more on the AI aspect of software development.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Since software is written in the form of algorithms, it makes sense to have a certain pattern of flow for the thought process that goes into developing software. I rely on pseudocode and flow diagrams to help me better understand and envision more complex solutions to problems.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

It is my ethical responsibility to give the end user full visibility of the information that they choose to provide, as well as full control to rescind access to their private information within a reasonable timeframe.
